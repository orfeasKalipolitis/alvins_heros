This project is created as a way for me to exercise using the 
React framework in the context of a MERN stack.

All game design ideas originate from and in their totallity belong
to Alvin Lion (@utbsyllion on Instagram).

This project is supposed to be an implementation of his original 
champion vs champion game. It should also allow for easy creation
and modification of said champions, so that iteration is faster.
